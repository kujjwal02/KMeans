# K Means

Pure python implementation of K-Means algorithm


## Requirements:
* Python3


## Input file format
each line in input file should be a list of numbers separated by spaces
example:
```
0.1 0.4 0.2
0.6 0.1 0.5
0.4 1.6 0.9
1.2 3.4 6.5
9.2 9.6 8.6
```

## Running instruction:
`python run_kmeans.py <inputfile> <No. of clusters>`

## For Detailed instructions run
`python run_kmeans.py -h`


## Example run
`python run_kmeans.py points.txt 2`

where _points.txt_ is a file with aforementioned format and 2 is the number of clusters
